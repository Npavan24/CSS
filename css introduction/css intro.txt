CSS Introduction:
   css stands for cascading style sheets.cascading refers to the styles that are applied to eleents in a web page.
   css is used to style/design the layout or apperance of webpages.

css can be used in html in 3 ways.
1.Inline styling.
2.Internal styling.
3.External styling.

1.Inline styling: it is used to apply styles to a specific element using 'style' as attribute.
 eg: <element style="property:value;....">content</element>


2.Internal styling: it is used to apply styles to a specific element or multiple elements using selectors 
and style as an element.
eg: 
    <style>
      selectors
      {
          property:value;....
      }
      </style>

     order: inline > internal

3. External styling: it is used to apply styles to single/multiple elements in a seperate file with .css extension
and attach it to the HTML using 'link' tag.
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="path to css" />

CSS styles of internal and external can override each other based on which comes last.

!important is the highest preferance for properties.
h1{
    color:red !important;
}
order of execution: !important > inline > internal/external.

Basic selectors: to apply styles to multiple elements we need to select the elements for that we use selectors.
Most common selectors are :

1.Tag name selector:it is used to select all elements of specific tag name.
    tagname{
        properties:values;
    }

2. class name: class is a attribute to elements which is used to select multiple elements. one element may contain 
multiple class names and multiple eleents may contain same class name.
    .classname{
        properties:values;
    }   

3.id: id is used to identify an element uniqely. no 2 elements have same id and no element will contain more than 
one id.
  #idname{
    properties:values;
  }
  id>class>tagname

 4.universal selector:if you want to apply all elements in a webpage, you can use universal selector (*).
    *{
        text-align:center;
    }
