Box Model: browsers treat every element as a box. A box contains 
1.border
2.border-radius
3.padding
4.margin

1.border: border is the surrounding line for an element.
      border: size shape color;
   we can even assign border-left,border-right,border-top,border-bottom.   

2. border-radius: it is the corner radius surround the border corners.
     border-radius:size;
     50% of border-radius make actual circle for square shape.
     we can also assign each corner radius seperately.

3. padding: it ia the space between the border and actual content of element(inside the element).
      padding:size;
      we can also assign padding as padding-left,padding-right.padding-top,padding-bottom.
      normally, padding makes each box increase its height or width because by default all are content-boxes.so 
      we need to use
      box-sizing:border-box;

4.margin: it is the space outside the border used for gap between the elements.           
      margin:size;
      we can also assign margin as margin-left,margin-right.margin-top,margin-bottom.
