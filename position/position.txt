position: position is used to keep elements at different places in user interface.
there are 5 positions available in css.such as
1.absolute
2.relative
3.static
4.fixed
5.sticky

1.static: by default all elements are static. static elements cannot have top,left,right,bottom.

2. absolute: absolute elements move according to the position of the body.
left:0px will actually move towards leftmost end of the screen.
scrolling have impact on absolute.

3.relative: relative elements move according to the position of current position. 
so left: 0px will not have impact towards it.

4.fixed: fixed elements also move according to body but it will not scroll.

5.sticky: sticky is nothing but relative + fixed. 
so intially it stays like relative but once it reaches certain point, 
it becomes fixed until it parent end reached.
