Media Queries: they are used for responsiveness of the website,
   we can make styles(css) works for specific widths.
   eg: large devices --->=1400px
   desktop --->=1280px to <1400px
   tablets --->=760px to 1080px
   mobiles(landscape) --->=576px to 768px
   mobiles(portrait) --- 0 to <576px

best approach for web design is mobile first design

   @media (min-width:1280px) and max-width:(1400px){
    /*laptops*/
   }


Animations: Animations are used to make an element goes through multiple states.
Every animation contain following properties such as 
  animation-name: name of the animation
  animation-duration: tie of the animation in seconds
  animation-timing-function: controls the speed of the animation(ease/ease in/ease out/easein-out/linear)
  animation-iteration-count: number of times animation repeats(number or infinite)
  animation-direction: decides which direction animation should run(normal/reverse/alternate/alternate-reverse)
  animation-delay: time to delay the animation(in seconds)

we can also use websites like "lottifiles" or "animista" for Animations.
