float: float is used to mske any element floating to the left or right side of screen.
    it makes the element remove from actual execution and next element takes up the space of floating element.
        float:left/right/none;
    we can even clear the floating element for any other elements using
        clear:left/right/both;
    
display: display is used to arrange the elements in a specific way.
    display : block -- will make the elements into blocks so that each element will display in new line.
    display : inline -- will make the elements into inline so that each element folloes the 
    previous elements(maintains same flow).    
    but inline elements cannot handle height/width/vertical margins.
    display: inline-block -- works like inline but accepts height/width.
    display: none -- removes the elements (visibility: hidden -- just hides the element).
